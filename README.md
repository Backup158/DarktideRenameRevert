# DarktideRenameRevert
Mod [(Nexus page)](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/394) to revert the weapon renames from the Unlocked and Loaded Update for Warhammer 40,000: Darktide.

Unlocked and Loaded, Patch #20 v1.5, launched on 2024/09/26, and it contained many changes to weapon names. The changes made are listed in Part 1 of the patch notes, which are found on the [Fatshark Forums](https://forums.fatsharkgames.com/t/unlocked-and-loaded-patch-notes-pt-1-out-now/98946). To the community, many of these changes seem arbitrary and only serve to confuse new players who find old resources. One of the worst offenders is renaming the Columnus Mk V Infantry Autogun (which the community called CIAG) to the Vraks Mk V Infantry Autogun, while they also renamed the Graia Mk VIII Infantry Autogun to Columnus Mk VIII Infantry Autogun. Many people have been confused by discussions involving the acronym CIAG, since some people call the VIAG by its former name.

This mod renames all the weapons to the pre-patch state. Now, the confusion will happen even more often because you won't be able to trust in-game screenshots to not use the old names!
